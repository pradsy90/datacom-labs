This lab is intended to give you just a bit more insight with respect to AWS cloud computing. In this lab, we will be setting up two machines and having them connect with each other. This lab is a bit different from the rest in that you will be sending me a request -- so we have work together just a bit. That is, you will need to request a peering connection on your end. I will say that I'm heading out of town this week (March 23, 2022) so I may not respond to your request but that's okay! There is still a way for you to demonstrate that you successfully made the request.

To start, login to your AWS account. There you will see VPCs along with other services in the VPC dashboard. 

.VPC

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
 
Click on the VPCs link and from there click Create VPC.

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
 
From there, name the VPC. In the CIDR block, put some block of local addresses. In this case I put a relatively small block of addresses.

Once you have created the VPC, create a subnet within that VPC. Clicking on the Subnets over on the left side, then clicking Create Subnet. Very similar (same?) to the work you did last week. 

.Create Subnet

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

In the create subnet screen, fill out the appropriate details. In this case, assign the subnet to the VPC that you just created. Also, In this example, the subnet is the size of the VPC (the blocks are the same size).

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Now create a route. The route will define where traffic can and can't flow in the VPC/subnet. Click Route Tables on the left side and then click Create route table. 

.Create Route Table

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Like the subnet, assign the route table to a VPC. Pretty easy.

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

At this point, you VPC is starting to get a bit of robustness associated with it. It has a name. It has a subnet. It has a route table. Growing up! Now you need to estabish an Internet Gatewary for your VPC -- so it can go on the internet. Click on Internet Gateways on the left and then click Create Internet Gateway. 

.Internet Gateway

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Name the Internet Gateway and click Create!

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

SUPER IMPORTANT!!! Once you create the gateway, the next screen will ask if I would like to associate the gateway with a VPC (green bar at the top). You must do this -- associating it with your newly created VPC.

Now return to your Route Table and add the newly created Internet Gateway.

You're now ready to create the Peering Connection! Click Peering Connections on the left and then Create Peering Connection on the top. The large numbers you see there are the things you are going to need to set up the peering conneciton

.Create Peering Connection
image::12.png[Create Peering Connection]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Here are the details of the Create Peering Connection page. These should be pretty straightforward. Basically, you are connecting your VPC to my VPC. The details in the bottom must be exactly as they are in this picture

.Peering Details
image::13.png[Peering Details]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Once, you finalize the details, you should see a banner like this: 

.Peering Request
image::21.png[Peering Request]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

This request is just a request at this point. It's not active until I accept it. For this lab, you don't have to wait for me to accept your request as our timing maybe off a bit and requests expire after a bit of time. 

What's intersting here is that there are two VPCs. Yours and mine. They are truly different VPCs but once I accept the peering connection, they are able to communicate and share resources with each other across the broader AWS landscape. 

YOU ARE DONE AT THIS POINT! But let me demonstrate what I mean by the above statements about peering. If I were to accept your peering request, you could add the newly created Peering Connection to your list of routes and 2) ensure that your route table is aligned with my subnet. 

.Add Peering Connection to Routes

.Associate Route Table with Subnet
image::16.png[Associate Route Table with Subnet]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

.Associate Route Table with Subnet
image::17.png[Associate Route Table with Subnet]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

At this point, the two VPCs are truly connected with each other. In context to things we've done in this class, we could ping instances between the VPCs or even SSH and modify docs between the VPCs. 

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

If (when) I accept the peering request, I will now see it as Active. If I don't accept the request in time, I'll see a red status marker and it'll say something like timeout.

{nbsp} +

That's it. The video should help too. I do have two questions I'd like you to also answer for this lab: 

1) What is peering?{nbsp} +
2) Draw me a picture of what has been designed here (the final design and not the process). This should include a VPCs, subnets, and any number-details that help me understand the design that was just created.
