# Server Deployment

This lab is to introduce Cloud Computing using the AWS EC2 environment from Amazon. Use your AWS Academy account. When you first login to AWS, you will see the AWS dashboard as described in the previous lab. This is all of the services that are provided via your account. On the dashboard, clicking on the EC2 link. This link open up the AWS dashboard page as shown below. This dashboard will enable us to launch a virtual machine (instance) in the AWS environment.

************************************************************
&nbsp;

You will set up a virtual server in this lab via the following:

.Launch Instance

Click the Launch Instance button

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Choose the first Amazon AMI. This is a distribution of Linux specific to Amazon. 

.Choose Amazon Linux AMI

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You have many options for the size of your virtual machine. Choose the t2.micro free tier and click Next.

&nbsp;

On the review page, when you click Launch, you are asked to Create/Choose/Select a key pair. 

.Launch

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Create a new key pair and enter your name for the key pair and download them. Make sure you download the .ppk (For Windows) or the .pem (For MacOs).. Then Click Launch!!

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You can return to my EC2 Dashboard and find your machine running (you can identify via the key that you just created in the Key Column). In the name column, also name your machine. 

.View Instances

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

On the instances dashboard, you will first see only one new instance. REPEAT ALL THE STEPS to create a second instance that is on the same subnet and uses the same security group. 

.Create Second Identical Instance

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Go to your EC2 Dashbaord, click on an instance and then click on the security group link on the left navigation bar. Get to the screen that shows the security rules for that security group. The screenshot below shows three rules, BUT , you should really see only one rule. You need to add the other two rules. 

.Security Group

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Once in the security group, you can Edit Inbound Rules. The reason that we couldn't ping is because we didn't enable the ping protocol. Let's do that. 

.Edit Inbound Rules

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Add a rule. Select ICMP. From Anywhere. Save the Rule. 

.Add ICMP

************************************************************
&nbsp;

Great job!! You've created to virtual machines in AWS using a variety of different tools. Now copy your Public IP address or your public IPv4 DNS. You will use these to SSH into both of your running machines. I showed how to do this in earlier class videos ;) 

.Copy Connection Information

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Now, try SSHing into the machines, pinging each machine separately, and then pinging between machines again. Also try pinging from your own personal machine. What are the results?
