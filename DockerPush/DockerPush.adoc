Welcome to your last lab in the IT Infrastrcuture course! Yes, we are at the end of the (strange) semester. Well done everyone. 

For this final lab, you are going to be using Docker again and, quite simply, you are going to be building a container that contains a Python script. The idea is to get you to see how you could package an application into a container that would ultimately be available for others. We are not going to be placing the container in any sort of registry, we are simply going to be making it on an AWS instance. Let's get started. 

To start, you will be using the AWS instance that I gave you a few weeks ago. This is the same instance that you used for your prior Docker lab. There is nothing special about this instance. Once you are logged into your AWS instance, make sure that Docker started: 

> sudo service docker start 

From here, we are going write the smallest Python script that we will place into a Docker container. In your current folder: 

> sudo nano helloworld.py

When inside nano, type: 

> print("hello world. Python for Docker!")

Save and exit nano and run the Python script at the command line: 

> python helloworld.py

This should simply print the line that you just typed. Easy enough so far. The point of this is that you are able to build an application on your local machine and ultimately place it into a Docker container, ensuring that it can be run on ANY system using Docker. Naturally, you will likely build more complex applications than helloworld but we're simply trying to see how this process would begin. Packaging a larger application into a Docker container is a bit more complex but follows similar logic to what we are doing here. It's also worth noting here that most Docker containers are pretty small applications (micro-services). 

Now, let's get the simple Python application into a container. To do this, we first need to create a Dockerfile: 

> sudo touch Dockerfile

This will create an empty Dockerfile. It is this file that will enable us to create a container. The next step is to edit the file: 

> sudo nano Dockerfile

Type (copy) and save the following: 

....

#Make sure that the use of the Container will always download the publicly available docker image "python" on Docker Hub. 
FROM python

#Creating directory helloworld in the container
RUN mkdir /home/helloworld

#Copying helloworld.py from our local directory to container's helloworld directory
COPY helloworld.py /home/helloworld/helloworld.py

#running helloworld.py in container
CMD python /home/helloworld/helloworld.py

....

Now, back at the command line, make sure that the Dockerfile is executable with the following command: 

> sudo chmod 755 Dockerfile 

Now, let's build the container with: 

> sudo docker build -t classtest .

You can now run the applicaiton in the Docker container: 

> sudo docker run classtest

You should see the helloword results! Nicely done. You can view the container with: 

> sudo docker ps -a

Now, let's push your new Docker container to Docker Hub. Similar to what you did in the last assignment (you pulled from Docker Hub), you can now take your Python script and push it to Docker Hub so that others could download (pull) it to their local Docker setup. The first thing we need to do is go to Docker Hub (you'll need to create an account) and setup a repository where you can push your Python script. First, you need to get your IMAGE ID. You can do this with the following command:

> sudo docker images

This will show you all your containters but most importanly the IMAGE ID that you will need to tag your container. Save this for just a bit later. 

Now, go to Docker Hub on the Internet. Create an account if you haven't already. It is within this account that we will push your Python script. If you haven't used Docker Hub before, it won't show any repositories. 

.Hub1
image::1.png[Hub1]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

You will need to create a repository that you can push your Python script to. Name this the same name as what you named your container. This should be a public repository. 

.Hub2
image::2.png[Hub2]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

You can then click on the repositry. There won't be anything in it but it'll show you the command to push things. This is the grey box in the upper right. 

.Hub3
image::3.png[Hub3]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Now you are all set on Docker Hub to which you can push your container. Return to your AWS instance to push the container. From here, tag your container so that it is inline with your Docker Hub account and repository

> sudo docker tag YOURIMAGEID YourDockerHubName/YourRepository:latest

Make sure you are logged in: 

> sudo docker login 

Enter your Docker Hub credentials. Then push! 

> sudo docker push YourDockerHubName/YourRepository:latest

Head over to Docker Hub and you should see that there is now code in your repository. It is this code that you (or anyone else) could pull down to run your container on their own local system. 

Finally, do the following (1) Modify your helloworld.py file to say some additional things, (2) Run your Docker container again (you'll see no change in your updated Python script), (3) rebuild your container with the build statement above, (4) rerun and repush your container and you'll see the changes reflected both locally and on Docker Hub.
