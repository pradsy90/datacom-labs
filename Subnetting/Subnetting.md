Subnetting
==========================

Like with cars, too much traffic causes congestion. Networks can be segmented to separate traffic. The segments are called subnetworks, or subnets. The subnet is defined by a subnet mask. 

Learning Objectives
--------------------------
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Determine the subnet mask.
2. Change the subnet for a deployed instance
3. Explain how subnetting effects the ability of computers on a network to communicate.

It is really, really important that you watch the videos this week to see the visuals of what is going on inside of AWS. I am not providing pictures here as I really need you to watch the videos to get oriented with the lab. 

Steps
--------------------------

### Step 1: Either restart or launch an instance that you used last week. 

In this part, you will need to either use the instances from last week or, if you terminated them, simply built a new instance just like you did last week. 


### Step 2: Build a new instance for this lab but on a new subnet

First, what are subnets? 

Subnet masks define the IP addresses for a subnetwork. Remember that IPv4 addresses are numbers ranging from 0 to 255. Subnet masks are more limited. It is easiest to see how subnet masks are defined in binary. The subnet mask 255.255.255.0 is very common, and is represented in binary as 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) can represent this subnet simply as "/24." Looking at the binary notation, from left to right there are 24 1's. Valid subnets always fill up the 1's on the left and zeros on the right; they are never mixed together.

|Netmask notation | Binary Representation               | [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) | Hosts |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|:----:|------:|
|255.255.0.0      | 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 | /16  | 65,533|
|255.255.255.0    | 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | /24  | 254   |
|255.255.255.128  | 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 | /25  | 126   |
|255.255.255.240  | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 | /28  | 14    |

You can calculate the number of hosts with a simple formula: (2^host bits)-2. So for the /28 subnet, there are 4 bits (i.e. 4 0's) for the host addresses. So we calculate 2^4-2=14. You can connect 14 computers on the /28 subnet. Each subnet has two reserved addresses--the [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork#subnet_zero) and the [broadcast address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address).

Consider two computers in an organization that are both configured with a /28 subnet mask. Computer A has an IP address of 192.168.16.36. Computer B has an IP address of 192.168.16.42. Are these computers in the same subnetwork? We start by determining the number of IP addresses in each network. In the /28 network, 4 bits are reserved for hosts, the broadcast, and network address. So, 2^4 gives us 16 IP addresses reserved for each network. Next, we start with the base network.

The first 2 octets of the /28 subnet mask are all 255, so we know that all network addresses will begin with the first 2 octets of our IP addresses: 192.168. We know that the first network will end with a 0, which gives us a starting network address of 192.168.X.0. For X, we simply substitute the number of IP addresses per subnet--16. So, our first network address will be 192.168.16.0. The next IP address will be the first valid host. The broadcast address will be the 16th IP address in the next work address. The last valid host will be the IP address immediately preceding the broadcast address.

Network Address | 1st Valid Host | Last Valid Host | Broadcast Address |
----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
192.168.16.0    | 192.168.16.1   | 192.168.16.14   | 192.168.16.15     |
192.168.16.16   | 192.168.16.17  | 192.168.16.30   | 192.168.16.31     |
192.168.16.32   | 192.168.16.33  | 192.168.16.46   | 192.168.16.47     |
192.168.16.48   | 192.168.16.49  | 192.168.16.62   | 192.168.16.63     |
192.168.16.64   | 192.168.16.65  | 192.168.16.78   | 192.168.16.79     |
192.168.16.80   | 192.168.16.81  | 192.168.16.94   | 192.168.16.95     |
192.168.16.96   | 192.168.16.97  | 192.168.16.110  | 192.168.16.111    |
192.168.16.112  | 192.168.16.113 | 192.168.16.126  | 192.168.16.127    |
192.168.16.128  | 192.168.16.129 | 192.168.16.142  | 192.168.16.143    |
192.168.16.144  | 192.168.16.145 | 192.168.16.158  | 192.168.16.159    |
192.168.16.160  | 192.168.16.161 | 192.168.16.174  | 192.168.16.175    |
192.168.16.176  | 192.168.16.177 | 192.168.16.190  | 192.168.16.191    |
192.168.16.192  | 192.168.16.193 | 192.168.16.206  | 192.168.16.207    |
192.168.16.208  | 192.168.16.209 | 192.168.16.222  | 192.168.16.223    |
192.168.16.224  | 192.168.16.225 | 192.168.16.238  | 192.168.16.239    |
192.168.16.240  | 192.168.16.241 | 192.168.16.254  | 192.168.16.255    |

There are only 16 subnets available on the /28 subnet. Looking at the preceding table of subnetworks, a clear pattern emerges. The first line takes some thought, but after that, you just add 16 to get the next network. Returning to the question asked previously, are computers A and B with IP addresses 192.168.16.36 and 192.168.16.42 on the same subnet? The answer is yes. Looking at the table above, the third network has IP addresses that range from 192.168.16.33 through 192.168.16.46. Computers A and B are both in that range, so they can communicate without having to route between networks.

It should be noted that machines on different networks can be configured with the same subnetwork settings but be unable to communicate. The 192.168 address space is reserved for local networks. A public library in Seattle might give and IP address to a computer of 192.168.1.1/24 to a user, while a business in Houston might assign the IP address 192.168.1.2/24 to another user. If those two addresses were on the same network, they could communicate. However, they are on separate networks. They are physically and logically disconnected. Traffic from the Seattle library network would have to be routed to the Houston business network for those machines to communicate. On a single network, IP addresses must be unique.

Now for finishing this step.... launch a third machine but this time, when you are in Step 3: Configure Instance Details, choose a different subnet than what your other two instances are on. Additionally, when you are in the security part of things, include both SSH and ICMP as security rules for the new instance. Once you've made this selection, you can follow the remaining steps as you have done in the past and simply launch the instance -- noting that the primary difference is that it is on a different subnet. 

### Step 3: Test Connections Between Machines on Different Subnets

In this next step, trying pinging between the machines (one on one subnet and the other on the other subnet). If your security profiles are set up as totally open for ICMP, you should be able to ping between all machines, no matter what subnet they are on. 

### Step 4: Modify your Security Rules to Isolate Subnets

Like last week's lab, we are going to go back into the security profiles and modify our ICMP rules to isolate our subnets. In short, you can simply modify the 0.0.0.0 to 0.0.0.0/20. In doing this you are limiting the different instances to only be able to communicate within their own subnet (a bit over 4,000 machines). 

Once you've isolated all three of your instances, try pinging between the two that are on the same subnet (two instances from last week) and between subnets (last week's instances with this week's new instance). The former should work, the latter should not work. 

### Step 5: Cleanup
You can stop all of your instances. This will help in not spending all of your AWS credits.
