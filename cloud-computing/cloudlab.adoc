This lab is to introduce Cloud Computing using the AWS Cloud environment from Amazon. In this lab, you will not be responsible for setting up your own AWS environment. Use your AWS Educate account (or your own personal account if that is the route you took). When you first login to AWS, you will see the AWS dashboard. This is all of the services that are provided via your account. On the dashboard, clicking on the EC2 link. This link will enable us to launch a virtual machine (instance) in the AWS environment.

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You will set up a virtual server in this lab via the following:

.Launch Instance
image::IMG2.png[Launch Instance]

Click the Launch Instance button

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Choose the first Amazon AMI. This is a distribution of Linux specific to Amazon. 

.Choose Amazon AMI

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You have many options for the size of your virtual machine. Choose the t2.micro free tier and click Next. 

.Instance Details

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Configure Details -- Notice the choices under subnet. Choose a specific subnet and write down the name of the subnet becasue you will be creating another virtual machine and you will be placing it in the same subnet --> and click Next.

Storage -- Leave the defaults and click Next.

&nbsp;

For Configure Security Group, set up an IT_Infrastrcuture Security Group. This group will give you the ability to run SSH traffic. Then click Review and Launch.

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

On the review page, when you click Launch, you are asked to Create/Choose/Select a key pair. 

.Launch

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Create a new key pair and enter your name for the key pair and download them. Then Click Launch!!

.Create Key Pair

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You can return to my EC2 Dashboard and find your machine running (you can identify via the key that you just created in the Key Column). In the name column, also name your machine. 

.View Instances
image::IMG11.png[View Instances]

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

On the instances dashboard, you will first see only one new instance. REPEAT ALL THE STEPS to create a second instance that is on the same subnet and uses the same security group. 

.Create Second Identical Instance
image::IMG12.png[Create Second Identical Instance]

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

This screen shows you how you can simply assign the second computer to an existing security group. You created this exisiting security group when you created the first instance. 

.Assigning to the Same Security Group

************************************************************
&nbsp;

Great job!! You've created to virtual machines in AWS using a variety of different tools. Now copy your Public IP address or your public IPv4 DNS. You will use these to SSH into both of your running machines. I showed how to do this in earlier class videos ;) 

.Copy Connection Information

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Once you have connected to both machines, trying pinging each other. Should this work? They are on the same subnets. 

.First Ping Doesn't Work
image::IMG15.png[First Ping Doesn't Work]

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

To fix this, return to your EC2 dashboard and either click on an instance or click on the security group link on the left navigation bar. These screens show the first route. Clicking on an instance will enable you to click on the Security tab. Click on the security group. 

.Security Group

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Once in the security group, you can Edit Inbound Rules. The reason that we couldn't ping is because we didn't enable the ping protocol. Let's do that. 

.Edit Inbound Rules
image::IMG18.png[Edit Inbound Rules]

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Add a rule. Select ICMP. From Anywhere. Save the Rule. 

.Add ICMP

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Finally, try pinging between machines again. Also try pinging from your own personal machine. What are the results?

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Explain what is going on resource-wise in this lab. 
* If the second machine was on a different subnet, what would have happened with the pings? 
* When setting up the subnets, there was a field called VPC. What is VPC?
