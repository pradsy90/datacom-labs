This lab is intended to give you an introduction to containers. We will be using Docker for this lab. For this lab, we will be deploying two containers in an AWS instance. This will include the install and deployment of containers via Docker. 
 
For the first part of this lab, it is important that you understand what a container is. Essentially, the deployment of an applicaiton can be a problematic endeavor. This is largely because as you deploy an application on one system, it is quite likely to not work on another -- due to the dependencies on one system to another. In short, all computer systems are not the same and deploying an application on one is likely different from another. 

Containers provide a highly 'containerized' environment that contains all of the necessary dependencies for an application to run. So when you deploy a container/application you can be confident that the application will run because it has been properly setup and will run on any computer that can run containers. A nice video is availble here that helps set up the difference Docker and the differentiation from virtualization:

We are going to be setting up a Docker environment in AWS. For this lab, I have sent you your own private IP address and key that you will use for the lab. You will not set up your own server. The server that I shared with you has all the necessary security settings needed for this lab.

Login to your AWS machine and install and start Docker: 

> sudo yum -y install docker 

> sudo service docker start 

From here, you can check to see if there are any Docker images on your machine (there will not be): 

> sudo docker images

.Docker Images

Now, we can do our first Docker image installation with the following command. Notice that it tries to run things locally but because it is not avaialble, it downloads it from the online registry. Also notice the PULL statement in the text as Hello-World is PULLED from the repository. 

> sudo docker run hello-world 

.Hello World
image::5.png[HelloWorld]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Now type: 

> sudo docker images

You should see the hello-world image in the list. 

But what else is available? Go and check out Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image). You can search for Apache (let's just stick with a known application for simplicity sake but you could substitute Apache for any other container). 

.ApacheOnDockerHub

> sudo docker run -dit --name web-3400 -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/website/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:latest

Once you run this run: 

> sudo docker images

You will see your latest downloaded Apache container (and it's already running). Change to the local directory at: 

> cd /home/user/website 

And make an index.html file. Then navigate to your IP address (get this from your AWS console) and goto your IPADDRESS:8080.

Once you've seen your server running, remember that it is running in a container, not natively on your AWS instance. Run the command to see your containers on your instance: 

> sudo docker ps -a 

.ShowContainers

Finally, we can login to our Apache container. Note that this IS differnet from a VM as it is using the same resources as the native AWS instance that you are on. It is just an assigned (and shared) space on the computer. 

> sudo docker exec -it web-3400 /bin/bash

If you do the following: 

> pwd 

You'll see your present working directory in the container. Then do: 

> ls 

You'll see a folder called htdocs. CD into that folder and do: 

> ls 

You'll see the index file you created in an earlier step but you can't modifiy it here. Why? Because you aren't really supposed to modify containers in production. They are meant to be self-contained applications in containers that you can ship to people and make sure that they work everywhere. If you let people modify things, like configuration files, it starts to defeat the purpose of containerization. That's the end of this intro to containers!
